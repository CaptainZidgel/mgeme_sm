This fork of MGEMod is controlled by websockets to coordinate games.
My philosophy in developing this fork is get-in-and-get-out. It isn't very clean.

MGEMod is a training mod for TF2 contributed to by many people, mainly Lange, and currently maintained by Sapphonie.
For more info on MGEMod, see its source, AlliedMods thread, or TF2Wiki page.

Websocket support via [RipExt](https://github.com/eldoradoel/sm-ripext-websocket), which actually just packages [this](https://github.com/Dreae/SourceMod-Websockets/) mod with dependencies.
Edit your databases.cfg per server network and mge_me.cfg per game server.
